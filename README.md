Objective: This project is a web-based application designed to process and visualize audio signals, focusing on speech and music signal processing. It provides real-time feedback on key audio features such as pitch while also offering waveform visualization.

Key Features:

1. Audio Upload and Processing:

Users can upload audio files directly through the interface using an <input> element that supports various audio formats.

The uploaded file is processed using the Web Audio API for feature extraction and analysis.



2. Real-Time Feature Extraction:

Basic audio features, such as pitch, are detected using a simplified algorithm.

The pitch detection function (dummy implementation) simulates the extraction of frequency-based features.



3. Waveform Visualization:

A waveform of the uploaded audio is rendered on an HTML <canvas> element.

The visualization is dynamically generated based on the audio data, displaying variations in amplitude over time.



4. Interactive Interface:

The interface is user-friendly, with a clean layout designed using CSS.

Interactive elements include buttons and file upload inputs for seamless user interaction.



5. Responsive Design:

The interface is mobile-friendly, ensuring that users can upload and process audio files on different devices.

Technologies Used:

1. HTML5: Provides the structure of the application, including sections for audio upload and output visualization.


2. CSS3: Ensures an aesthetic and responsive design with a green-themed color palette.


3. JavaScript:

Handles the logic for audio processing, feature extraction, and visualization.

Uses the Web Audio API for decoding and analyzing audio files.



4. Web Audio API: Implements audio signal processing and feature extraction.


5. Canvas API: Visualizes the waveform of the uploaded audio.

Workflow:

1. Audio Upload:

Users upload an audio file through the file input element.

The uploaded file is read as an array buffer using the FileReader API.



2. Audio Processing:

The Web Audio API decodes the audio data into a format suitable for analysis.

Basic pitch detection (dummy logic in this case) computes the frequency of the signal.



3. Visualization:

The waveform of the audio is rendered on a canvas element.

The amplitude variations of the signal are drawn using getContext('2d') for real-time graphical representation.



4. Output Results:

The pitch is displayed as a numerical value (in Hz) in the results section.

The canvas element updates with the waveform visualization.

Applications:

1. Educational Tool:

Teaches concepts of audio signal processing, pitch detection, and waveform visualization.



2. Audio Analysis:

Provides a basic platform for analyzing speech and music signals.



3. Prototype for Advanced Features:

Can be extended for advanced signal processing tasks such as noise reduction, speech recognition, or music transcription.
